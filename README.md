    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

To use in Observable,

```javascript
someOwnBy = require( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/utils-some-own-by@umd/browser.js' )
```
The previous example will load the latest bundled code from the umd branch. Alternatively, you may load a specific version by loading the file from one of the [tagged bundles](https://github.com/stdlib-js/utils-some-own-by/tags). For example,

```javascript
someOwnBy = require( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/utils-some-own-by@v0.1.1-umd/browser.js' )
```

To vendor stdlib functionality and avoid installing dependency trees for Node.js, you can use the UMD server build:

```javascript
var someOwnBy = require( 'path/to/vendor/umd/utils-some-own-by/index.js' )
```

To include the bundle in a webpage,

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/utils-some-own-by@umd/browser.js"></script>
```

If no recognized module system is present, access bundle contents via the global scope:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
(function () {
    window.someOwnBy;
})();
</script>
```

#### someOwnBy( obj, n, predicate\[, thisArg ] )

Tests whether an `object` contains at least `n` own properties which pass a test implemented by a `predicate` function.

```javascript
function isNegative( value ) {
    return ( value < 0 );
}

var obj = {
    'a': 1,
    'b': -2,
    'c': 3,
    'd': -1
};

var bool = someOwnBy( obj, 2, isNegative );
// returns true
```

Once the function finds `n` successful properties, the function **immediately** returns `true`.

```javascript
function isPositive( value ) {
    if ( value < 0 ) {
        throw new Error( 'should never reach this line' );
    }
    return ( value > 0 );
}

var obj = {
    'a': 1,
    'b': 2,
    'c': -3,
    'd': 4
};

var bool = someOwnBy( obj, 2, isPositive );
// returns true
```

The invoked `function` is provided three arguments:

-   `value`: object property value
-   `key`: object property key
-   `obj`: input object

To set the function execution context, provide a `thisArg`.

```javascript
function sum( value ) {
    this.sum += value;
    this.count += 1;
    return ( value < 0 );
}

var obj = {
    'a': 1,
    'b': 2,
    'c': 3,
    'd': -5
};

var context = {
    'sum': 0,
    'count': 0
};

var bool = someOwnBy( obj, 1, sum, context );
// returns true

var mean = context.sum / context.count;
// returns 0.25
```

## Notes

-   An [`Object`][mdn-object] refers to a JavaScript object, which is a collection of properties. Each property is an association between a key (or name) and a value. The key can be a string or a symbol, and the value can be any JavaScript value, including functions and other objects

-   If provided an empty `object`, the function returns `false`.

    ```javascript
    function alwaysTrue() {
        return true;
    }
    var bool = someOwnBy( {}, 1, alwaysTrue );
    // returns false
    ```

-   The function does **not** skip `undefined` elements.

    <!-- eslint-disable no-sparse-arrays, stdlib/doctest-marker -->

    ```javascript
    function log( value, key ) {
        console.log( '%s: %s', key, value );
        return ( value < 0 );
    }

    var obj = {
        'a': 1,
        'b': void 0,
        'c': void 0,
        'd': 4,
        'e': -1
    };

    var bool = someOwnBy( obj, 1, log );
    /* =>
        a: 1
        b: void 0
        c: void 0
        d: 4
        e: -1
    */
    ```

-   The function provides limited support for dynamic objects (i.e., objects whose `length` changes during execution).
